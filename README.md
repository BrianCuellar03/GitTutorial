# GitTutorial For Junior Seminar Class

Imagine you're working on a massive jigsaw puzzle with friends, where each piece represents a change or addition you make to a project. Now, imagine if you could save your progress at any moment, 
experiment with placing pieces without risking the entire puzzle, and even go back in time to see how you got to a certain point. Essentially, this is what Git does for software development. 

Git is a version control system, a tool that tracks every single change made to a project's files. It's like a detailed history book of your project, allowing you to pinpoint who made changes, what was changed, and when it happened. This is incredibly useful when you're working in a team and need to collaborate without interfering with other collaborators.
